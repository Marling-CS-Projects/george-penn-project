![The base idea i have chosen for my project.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-03-17 at 10.06.33.png>)

## What are the benefits of playing video games in general?

**Point:** Firstly, there are a multitude of mental health benefits that can come as a result of playing video games.&#x20;

**Evidence:** Games, especially ones in the category of the game that i'm planning to create, are able to improve ones problem solving skills under pressure. Jane Mcgonigal, American game designer and author, stated in a TED talk that gamers are 'out of the box problem solvers'. She claimed that when playing games that require problem solving skills, players spend 80% of play time failing. This failure is made fun in the form of a game, and the more a player fails, the harder they try to form a solution to the problem. This is a valuable skill that can be used in real life. (Brooke)
