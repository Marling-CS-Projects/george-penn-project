## Age Rating

The age rating for my game is a good starting point for finding my game's target audience, as age is one of the best factors for narrowing down a demographic. An age rating is designed to be assigned to a piece of media in order to inform potential consumers on what kind of content they might find in the media.



### PEGI Rating

One of the most common forms of age rating for video games, films and other media in Europe is the Pegi rating. Pegi stands for Pan European Game Information and their ratings on media serve as an indicator for audiences -mainly parents- to know wether the content is suitable for them or their children. An important thing to note is that Pegi ratings do not take the difficulty of a game into consideration, only the maturity of the content in it. (PEGI) For example, a game could be as difficult as the infamous Dark souls but if it had no violence, scares, bad language etc, it could still be classed as suitable for 3 year olds.
