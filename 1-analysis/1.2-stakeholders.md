## Age Rating

The age rating for my game is a good starting point for finding my game's target audience, as age is one of the best factors for narrowing down a demographic. An age rating is designed to be assigned to a piece of media in order to inform potential consumers on what kind of content they might find in the media.



### PEGI Rating

One of the most common forms of age rating for video games, films and other media in Europe is the Pegi rating. Pegi stands for Pan European Game Information and their ratings on media serve as an indicator for audiences -mainly parents- to know wether the content is suitable for them or their children. An important thing to note is that Pegi ratings do not take the difficulty of a game into consideration, only the maturity of the content in it. (PEGI) For example, a game could be as difficult as the infamous Dark souls but if it had no violence, scares, bad language etc, it could still be classed as suitable for 3 year olds.

Pegi ratings also come with content descriptors to state the specific factors of the game that justify the given rating.



My game would most likely have a Pegi Rating of 12. The official Pegi website describes 12 rated games as 'Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild'. My game will definitely feature violence, being centred around fighting a boss, however the violence wont be realistic or particularly gory.&#x20;
