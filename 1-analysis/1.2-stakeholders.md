## Age Rating

The age rating for my game is a good starting point for finding my game's target audience, as age is one of the best factors for narrowing down a demographic. An age rating is designed to be assigned to a piece of media in order to inform potential consumers on what kind of content they might find in the media.



### PEGI Rating

One of the most common forms of age rating for video games, films and other media in Europe is the Pegi rating. Pegi stands for Pan European Game Information and their ratings on media serve as an indicator for audiences -mainly parents- to know wether the content is suitable for them or their children. An important thing to note is that Pegi ratings do not take the difficulty of a game into consideration, only the maturity of the content in it. (PEGI) For example, a game could be as difficult as the infamous Dark souls but if it had no violence, scares, bad language etc, it could still be classed as suitable for 3 year olds.

Pegi ratings also come with content descriptors to state the specific factors of the game that justify the given rating.



My game would most likely have a Pegi Rating of 12. The official Pegi website describes 12 rated games as 'Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild'. My game will definitely feature violence, being centred around fighting a boss, however the violence wont be realistic or particularly gory. Pegi 12 is also the minimum age rating that can be given to a game that includes gambling.



### ESRB Rating

Like the Pegi rating, an ESRB rating is similar in that it provides an indicator (mainly for parents) of how mature or appropriate a game's content might be. Also similarly to Pegi, ESRB does not take difficulty into consideration.(“Home - ESRB Ratings”)

My game would most likely have an ESRB rating of Teen. I could probably make the game under the Everyone 10+ rating to broaden the demographic, but i would miss out on being able to implement the gambling mechanic, and wouldn't have as much creative freedom.



## Do single player games still have a demographic?

In the modern day, multiplayer games have only become more popular in the market, providing more and more experiences for friends to share together without having to arrange any real life meet-ups. However, does this mean that single player games have been rendered out of fashion?\
\
The short answer is no. There is still a demographic for offline single player. Statista published the results of a U.S survey where participants where asked what kind of games they prefer. A huge 59% of players said they preferred to play single player games where they are against the computer, rather than against other players. (Clement 2021)
