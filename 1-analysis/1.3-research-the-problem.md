## Cuphead

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Cuphead is a single player (can also be played locally with a second player) game where the primary objective is to defeat al of the game's 19 bosses, with the games end being reached after defeating the final boss; the Devil. The game's main selling point was its very unique art style, with characters and the world being drawn in the style of 1950s cartoons and effects on the screen that increase the immersion by making the player feel like theyre playing on an old TV. This combined with the music and sound effects gives the game a nostalgic, disney like feeling to the game which makes boss fights out of the many wacky tropes of cartoon violence.
