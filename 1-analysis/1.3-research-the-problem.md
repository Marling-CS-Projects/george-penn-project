## Cuphead

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Cuphead is a single player (can also be played locally with a second player) game where the primary objective is to defeat al of the game's 19 bosses, with the games end being reached after defeating the final boss; the Devil. The game's main selling point was its very unique art style, with characters and the world being drawn in the style of 1950s cartoons and effects on the screen that increase the immersion by making the player feel like theyre playing on an old TV. This combined with the music and sound effects gives the game a nostalgic, disney like feeling to the game which makes boss fights out of the many wacky tropes of cartoon violence.



### Controls

The game can be played on controller or keyboard and mouse. On keyboard (which is the control input that my game will be using, the game uses the usual WASD keys for moving your character, and the mouse is used for aiming your attacks. Your basic attack is fired by holding the x key and your special attack is used by pressing V. You also have a dash that is used with LShift, and a parry which is used by pressing the jump key when making contact with certain objects marked in pink.&#x20;

### Boss Phases

Something that really makes the bosses in Cuphead stand out are different 'phases' that they involve. Each different phase of a fight changes the bosses look and gives them a brand new pool of attacks. For example, one boss fight starts with you fighting a bee police officer in a hive, then the queen bee, before the queen bee turns in to a literal bomber plane in the final phase.

### Customisation

Another enjoyable part of the game is the ability to change the type of weapon fire you can use, along with equipping 3 other items that can give you extra perks, such as more health or a better dash. Each different weapon comes with a unique basic fire and special attack. You can equip two weapon types at a type, being able to switch between them at any time during levels. This gives the game an extra sense of strategy as you can prepare your build accordingly for each challenge. The player can also choose between 1 of 3 SUPERS, ultimate moves that can be charged and released by stockpiling 5 special attack charges.

| Feature           | Justification                                                                                                                     |

| Boss fight phases | It keeps the boss fight feeling fresh and exciting while challenging. It will also be a good medium for implementing checkpoints. |
| Movement controls | Using WASD is convenient, and something that any PC gamers will already be familiarised with.                                     |
| SUPER move        | I like the idea of an extra powerful move that can be used only occasionally. It adds another strategic element to the game.      |

| Feature                           | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No checkpoints during boss fights | This is suitable for a game like Cuphead, where the bosses are difficult but not too long, whereas it would have a negative impact on my game that features one very long boss fight. This would ramp up the difficulty in a way i feel is too much. |
| Choose any build you want         | I want my game to feel chaotic and unexpected. For this reason, the player wont get to choose exactly what items and buffs they get, instead having to pick from random selections and improvise a little.                                           |
| Art style                         | The art style of cuphead is one that takes incredible amounts of time to complete. I will be using a pixelated art style as they are easier to make effective.                                                                                       |

### Overview

Dead cells is a rogue-like combat platformer game in which the player must escape an island riddled with disease by battling through levels crawling with hostile enemies and defeating difficult bosses with intricate attack patterns.

Although you return to the start each time, you collect permanent upgrades to your character and unlock new items as you play game.
