## Cuphead

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Cuphead is a single player (can also be played locally with a second player) game where the primary objective is to defeat al of the game's 19 bosses, with the games end being reached after defeating the final boss; the Devil. The game's main selling point was its very unique art style, with characters and the world being drawn in the style of 1950s cartoons and effects on the screen that increase the immersion by making the player feel like theyre playing on an old TV. This combined with the music and sound effects gives the game a nostalgic, disney like feeling to the game which makes boss fights out of the many wacky tropes of cartoon violence.



### Controls

The game can be played on controller or keyboard and mouse. On keyboard (which is the control input that my game will be using, the game uses the usual WASD keys for moving your character, and the mouse is used for aiming your attacks. Your basic attack is fired by holding the x key and your special attack is used by pressing V. You also have a dash that is used with LShift, and a parry which is used by pressing the jump key when making contact with certain objects marked in pink.

### Boss Phases

Something that really makes the bosses in Cuphead stand out are different 'phases' that they involve. Each different phase of a fight changes the bosses look and gives them a brand new pool of attacks. For example, one boss fight starts with you fighting a bee police officer in a hive, then the queen bee, before the queen bee turns in to a literal bomber plane in the final phase.
