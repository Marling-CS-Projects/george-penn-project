# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Controls and Movement

The game will be played exclusively on keyboard. The mouse will not be used to aim weapon fire. Instead weapons will have fixed animations, with ranged ones most likely firing straight forward or in a set spread. Instead of aiming, the player will have to use movement to get into positions in which their weapon will hit effectively. WASD keys will be used for movement, as standard in the industry. The left shift key will most likely be used for the dodge action, and arrow keys will be used for attacks and ultimate ability. The player will have a quick acceleration  between being stationary and moving at full speed. The player's jump will reach a fixed height, rising and falling with fixed gravity. This will make the player able to predict how well they can dodge an attack by jumping.&#x20;

### Level Layout

The level will simply be limited to the size of the screen, with the possibility of layout changes throughout the game if i have time to implement them. This is because i felt that making a large level for a boss fight was unnessecary and would require a working camera to be coded instead of having the perspective be stationary. Im planning for the layout of the level to be fairly simple, with a flat ground, some platforms and maybe some pits to the sides. It will look sort of like a stage from Super Smash Bros.

### Boss Moveset

During each phase i will give the boss a select group of attacks. It will randomly choose one of these to use against the player at a regular looping interval. Every attack pattern will have roughly the same length to prevent their being issues of attack commands overlapping or there being long delays between attacks. I will need to make sure that each attack can string well with whatever possible attack comes next to make the game challenging but not broken or impossible.

## Graphics



### User Interface

The user interface will look sleek and simple, containing important info such as the players health, the bosses health, the weapon, perks and super ability charge that the player has. I do not want the UI to feel cluttered so that the player can put their focus into the actual gameplay.

### Game Graphics

My game will adopt a 2d, pixelated artstyle. This is because pixelated artstyles are able to accomplish a lot with a little. This is due to how the brain works, seeing a pixelated image and being able to use imagination to interpret what is shown. The attacks will be shown in bright colours that stand out from the scene so that the player is not confused about what will hurt them and what wont.



## Sound

### Music

The full duration of the game will have some sort of intense, fast paced, upbeat track to accompany the violent and quick nature of the boss and the game. I will choose a single song on a loop, as i dont want the music to distract from the gameplay too much.

### SFX

Boss attacks will be telegraphed with alarming noises that will grab the player's attention. The player and bosses attacks themselves will have sound effects. Sound effects will aslo play when the player jumps, takes damage, dies, etc.

## Limitations

### Platform availability

My game will only be available to play on PC platforms. This is due to time constraints and the extra complications that come with coding a game for multiple platforms. The reason that i have chosen PC as the single platform to create the game for is that it will be the platform that i develop the game on. This will make it so that i can quickly test the game without having to use another device.

### Game length and depth

I want the boss fight to contain multiple phases, but i most likely wont be able to implement the amount of phases and attacks that my boss would have if my project was not limited by time. Having a fairly game will also help with testing, as testing a single run of the game start to finish wont take too long to do.

### Game performance

The game will most likely be web based, and as a result its limitations will be bound to that of the browser it is played in. This can be seen as a positive, as most PCs can run most browsers which will mean that the game will be very accessible and will not require a powerful computer to play it.

### Graphics

I will keep my graphics very simple but understandable. I will prioritise the functionality of the game over the look of it, as there is no point in making the game look nice if it doesnt work properly.

### Sound effects

I will only implement sound effects for things that i feel are absolutely necessary for the atmosphere of the game. This is for a similar reasoning to why i will be using simple graphics. Coding in extra sound effects would take way time that could be used to make sure the game is working correctly.
