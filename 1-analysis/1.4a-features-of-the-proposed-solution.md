# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Controls

The game will be played exclusively on keyboard. The mouse will not be used to aim weapon fire. Instead weapons will have fixed animations, with ranged ones most likely firing straight forward or in a set spread. Instead of aiming, the player will have to use movement to get into positions in which their weapon will hit effectively. WASD keys will be used for movement, as standard in the industry.&#x20;

## Limitations

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
