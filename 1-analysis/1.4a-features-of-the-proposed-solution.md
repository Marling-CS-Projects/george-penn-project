# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Controls and Movement

The game will be played exclusively on keyboard. The mouse will not be used to aim weapon fire. Instead weapons will have fixed animations, with ranged ones most likely firing straight forward or in a set spread. Instead of aiming, the player will have to use movement to get into positions in which their weapon will hit effectively. WASD keys will be used for movement, as standard in the industry. The left shift key will most likely be used for the dodge action, and arrow keys will be used for attacks and ultimate ability. The player will have a quick acceleration  between being stationary and moving at full speed. The player's jump will reach a fixed height, rising and falling with fixed gravity. This will make the player able to predict how well they can dodge an attack by jumping.&#x20;



### Level Layout

The level will simply be limited to the size of the screen, with the possibility of layout changes throughout the game if i have time to implement them. This is because i felt that making a large level for a boss fight was unnessecary and would require a working camera to be coded instead of having the perspective be stationary.&#x20;

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
