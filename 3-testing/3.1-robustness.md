# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 22        | The game must run without crashing or freezing.       |
| 23        | The game should run at 30fps                          |
| 25        | The game's music should be set to the correct volume. |

### Criterion 22

The game consistently runs without any freezes or crashes. The game did not crash at all across the entire project process. The only time the game wouldn't work is when it wouldn't start due to coding errors.



### Criterion 23

The game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, double the amount required on the criterion.



### Criterion 25

The game's volume is set to an appropriate default level. The music and sounds a balanced out so that both are audible clearly to the player. It took some time of changing values around to get the volume to a good level.&#x20;
