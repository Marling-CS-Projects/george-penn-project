| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Do you feel that the game is appropriately challenging? Do you feel that the game is a fun way to kill short amounts of time? Would you recommend it to a friend?                   |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls satisfying and easy to use? Do you feel appropriately equipped to dodge hazards?  Did you find any bugs in the game?                                               |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you feel that item blocks add an interesting gameplay element?  Do you feel that Hard Mode is an enjoyable addition to the game? Do you feel that the music and SFX are fitting? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Do you feel that the game has replay value?                                                                                                                                         |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Do you understand the objective?                                                                                                                                                    |

Listed below are the results of the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Effective

The element of challenge is an important part of the game's enjoyability, and the survey shows that every user agreed (mostly strongly) that the game had an appropriate challenge level, being difficult but not overdoing it.

Being able to enjoy the game in short amounts of time is what I believe would be one of the main appeals of the game, and the majority of users agreed with this statement. However, a portion of users strongly disagreed which shows that this type of appeal could be worked on more.

A large majority of users said that they would recommend the game to a friend, supporting the case for the game being an enjoyable experience for users.

### Efficient

All users involved in the survey agreed that the controls of the game felt good and were easy to get used to. This is an important factor, as i wanted the controls to feel very tight and responsive.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.05.11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players agreed that they had enough tools/controls available to them to adequately be able to dodge incoming obstacles. This ties into the need for the game to feel like the right level of challenge.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.25.20.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Only one player reported an (actual) bug while playing the game, that being that switching between the info screen and the start screen did not always work.&#x20;

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.08.50.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players agreed that the item blocks were an interesting gameplay feature, proving their addition to be worthwhile.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.21.50.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players enjoyed the game's extra 'Hard Mode" feature, showing that players enjoy the addition of more challenging options to an already challenging game.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.22.25.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A large majority of players appreciated the choice of music and sound effects for the game. This is important as sound is key to the immersion of a game.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 17.10.03.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players strongly agreed that the game has replay value. This is very important as the game is designed to be very replayable.

### Easy to Learn



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 16.59.09.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All players strongly agreed that the objective of the game is easy to understand, supporting the 'easy to learn but hard to master' element of the game i was trying to get my game to have.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria
