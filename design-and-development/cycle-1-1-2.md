# Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

* [x] Change the sizes and scales of different aspects of the current games. Im not happy with the current feel of the game as the player sprite is too small, and the jump height is not great enough for the player to reach the platforms. I may also alter the layout of the level by adding more platforms.

### Usability Features

This will make the game feel more smooth and interactive with the platforms and will make the player more comfortable using the platforms and movement to dodge enemy attacks.

### Key Variables
