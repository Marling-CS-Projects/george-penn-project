# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

Load sprites as objects and create two scenes, a start screen scene and a gameplay scene in order to create a level design for my Mario game (practicing with kaboom.js

* [x] Load all of the sprites onto objects&#x20;
* [x] Create two separate scenes
* [x] design a level using the objects that ive coded

### Usability Features

The player will be able to interact with the level that i have created, and will recognize what each thing is thanks to the sprites representing them.
