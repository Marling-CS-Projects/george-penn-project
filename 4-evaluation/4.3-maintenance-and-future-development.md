# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Game has a relatively small amount of content, most likely only suitable for play sessions around 10 or so minutes long.
* The final product is very different from original vision for the game. Certain features such as boss phases, weapons and an 'end' to the game. While i am satisfied with the final product, it does not match the original vision that i had for the game. This was mainly due to my original plan being much more difficult to code than I had anticipated.
* Graphics have a lot of room for improvement. While the game's current graphics do the job that they are needed for, the game's graphics could add more appeal to the game if they were more detailed, as this would make the game feel more polished and add more quality to the product.
